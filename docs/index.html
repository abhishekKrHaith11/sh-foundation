        <p>Shreshtha Heritage Foundation is committed to creating an informed awareness of our rich cultural heritage
            specifically the performing arts so that it becomes relevant to the community and empowers them for holistic
            personality development.</p>
        <p>Performing Arts is an important tool of expression dating to a hoary past. In the journey of Missing
            Milestones
            and Changing Landscapes and perceptions of the modern era, our heritage that has taken a backseat is now
            being
            brought to the forefront through youngsters seriously taking up Performing Arts as a career.</p>
        <p>With the introduction of the liberal arts in colleges and universities, there is a renewed interest in the
            humanities
            subjects. In a happening City like Bengaluru, the opportunities for knowledge transmission are plenty.</p>
        <p>We hope to bridge the gap through performances, and workshops and provide a national platform for budding and
            deserving artists. As a future plan, we will also be documenting for archival records the rich Tribal and
            Folk
            heritage that is slowly disappearing.</p>
